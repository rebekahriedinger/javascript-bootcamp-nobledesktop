1. Write a nested if-else block, that satisfies the following conditions:

   - If the student score is greater than or equal to 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "A", but if they are in college they get a grade of 4.
   - If the student score is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "B", but if they are in college they get a grade of 3.
   - If the student score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "C", but if they are in college they get a grade of 2.

```
    let studentScore = 94;
    let isHighSchool = true;
    let grade;

    if(student_score >= 90) {
        if(isHighSchool) {
            grade = "A";
        } else {
            grade = 4;
        }
    } else if(student_score >= 80) {
        if(isHighSchool) {
            grade = "B";
        } else {
            grade = 3;
        }
    } else if(student_score >= 70) {
        if(isHighSchool) {
            grade = "C";
        } else {
            grade = 2;
        }
    } else {
        grade = "FAIL";
    }

    console.log(grade);
```

2. Write a nested if-else block, that satisfies the following conditions:

   - If the pet is a cat, increase the pet price by 20%, unless it is a baby cat, in which case decrease the price by 10%.
   - If the pet is a dog, increase the pet price by 30%, unless it is a baby dog, in which case decrease the price by 15%.
   - If the pet is anything besides a dog or a cat, double the price, unless it is a baby version of the pet, in which case cut the price in half.

```
    let pet = "cat";
    let price = 100;
    let baby = false;

    if(pet == "cat") {
        if(baby) {
            // to decrease a number by 10%, multiply it by 0.9
            price *= 0.9;
        } else {
            // to increase a number by 20%, multiply it by 1.2
            price *= 1.2;
        }
    } else if(pet == "dog") {
        if(baby) {
            // to decrease a number by 15%, multiply it by 0.85
            price *= 0.85;
        } else {
            // to increase a number by 30%, multiply it by 1.3
            price *= 1.3;
        }
    } else {
        if(baby) {
            // to decrease a number by half (50%), multiply it by 0.5
            price *= 0.5;
        } else {
            // to double a number, multiply it by 2
            price *= 2;
        }
    }

    console.log(price);
```
