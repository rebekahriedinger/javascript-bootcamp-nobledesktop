// Word Frequency Map for a Word Cloud
// A Word Cloud is a visual representation of the frequency of words in a string,
// such as found in a blog post or other article; in a word cloud, the most frequently
// occurring words appear in the largest font size in order to do this, the frequency of words // must be known. Therefore, before we can make a Word Cloud, we have to make what is called
// a Word Frequency Map from of the words. This takes the form of an Object, where the keys
// are unique words and the value of each key is the number of times the word occurs.
// To make the Word Frequency Map, we have to convert the text to an array, with each item
// a word. Then we loop through the array of words. every time a unique word is found,
/// the object is assigned that word as a new key with an initial value of 1.
// the next time the word is encounterd, no new key is made, but rather the value of the // ///// existing key is incremented by 1
// the resulting Word Frequency Map can then be used to make a Word Cloud by setting the font
// size of each word based on the frequency, with most frequent words biggest
// also, since a Word Cloud only contains interesting, important keywords, there needs to be
// a filter that prevents what are known as stopwords from being included in the Word
// Frequency Map. Stopwords include such common words as 'the', 'and', 'of', 'on', 'with', etc.

// let stopwords = ["foo", "bar"]; // for making Word Freq Map with no stopwords filtering

function makeWordFreqMap(str, stopwords) {
  str = str.trim().toLowerCase(); // lower case so that "Land" and "land" are not counted separately
  // remove punctuation so that "world." and "world" are not saved as separate keys
  // str = str.replace(",", "");
  // str = str.replace(".", "");
  // str = str.replace(";", "");
  // str = str.replace(":", "");
  // str = str.replace("?", "");
  // str = str.replace("!", "");
  // or use fancy RegEx move to strip all non-alphanumeric characters
  str = str
    .replace(/[^\w\s]|_/g, "")
    .replace(/\s+/g, " ")
    .replace(/[0-9]/g, "");
  // RegEx gibberish decoded:
  // \w is any digit, letter, or underscore.
  // \s is any whitespace.
  // [^\w\s] is anything that's not a digit, letter, whitespace, or underscore.
  // [^\w\s]|_ is the same as #3 except with the underscores added back in.
  // [0-9] is all digits
  // /g is globally replace (everywhere)
  // str = str.trim(); // get rid of any extra whitespace that still may remain
  let arr = str.split(" "); // make an array of the words, each word an array item
  let obj = {}; // declare a new object
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let word = arr[i];
    if (!stopwords.includes(word)) {
      // if the current word is NOT one of the stopwords // if the current word is not already an object key, make it a key w an initial value of 1, else increment the value of the word key by 1
      !obj[word] ? (obj[word] = 1) : obj[word]++;
    } // end if-else
  } // end for loop
  return obj; // output the function
} // end function
