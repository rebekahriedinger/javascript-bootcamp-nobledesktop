   - If the student score is greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "B", but if they are in college they get a grade of 3.
   - If the student score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "C", but if they are in college they get a grade of 2.

2. Write a nested if-else block, that satisfies the following conditions:

   - If the pet is a cat, increase the pet price by 20%, unless it is a baby cat, in which case decrease the price by 10%.
   - If the pet is a dog, increase the pet price by 30%, unless it is a baby dog, in which case decrease the price by 15%.
   - If the pet is anything besides a dog or a cat, double the price, unless it is a baby version of the pet, in which case cut the price in half.
