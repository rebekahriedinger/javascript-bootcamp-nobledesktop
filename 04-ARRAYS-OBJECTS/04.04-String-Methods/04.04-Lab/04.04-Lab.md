# String Methods

<br>

Given this array of vegetables:

```
    const veggies = ['Cucumber', 'Tomato', 'Kale'];
```

1. Use the **replace()** method and array items to log the expected message to the console:

```
    let msg1 = 'Have you ever ordered the Sandwich?';
    console.log(msg1); // Have you ever ordered the Cucumber Sandwich?
```

2. Use the replace() method and array items to log the expected message to the console:

```
    let msg2 = 'The "T" in "BLT" stands for "Terminator."';
    console.log(msg2); // The "T" in "BLT" stands for "Tomato."
```

3. Use the replace() method and array items to log the expected message to the console:

```
    let msg3 = 'Bunny goes to Yale University.';
    console.log(msg3); // Bunny goes to Kale University.
```

Given this array of fruits and vegetables:

```
    const words = [
      "Avocado",
      "Broccoli",
      "Cauliflower",
      "Dragonfruit",
      "Eggplant",
    ];
```

4. Use the includes() method and if-else logic to check if the word starts with a consonant or a vowel

- If the word is "Avocado", log: Avocado starts with "A", which is a vowel.
- If the word is "Broccoli", log: Broccoli starts with "B", which is a consonant.

We'll run it each time on a random word from the array. Reload the page to make sure it works with vowel words and consonant words.

```
    let r = Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length);
    let word = words[r];
    let firstChar;
    console.log('firstChar', firstChar);
    let vowels;
    if(vowels) {
    }
```

REFACTOR: Since the if-else console logs differ only in one word: vowel / consonant,
better would be to have a variable "consonant" that the if statements sets to "vowel" and then concat that "consonant" or "vowel" vvariable into the output:  
Try it again:

```
    let consonantOrVowel;
    if(vowels) {
    }
```

Given this file name:

```
    let fileName = "Mets-Lead-Off-Game-By-Hitting-Three-Straight-Homers.html";
```

5. Turn the file name into a news headline, with all words capitalized:

Expected result:  
**Mets Lead Off Game By Hitting Three Straight Homers**

```
    let wordsArr;
    console.log(wordsArr); // ['Mets', 'Lead', 'Off', 'Game', 'By', 'Hitting' .. etc.]
    let headline;
```

Remove the file extension, but don't assume '.html' -- detect the dot and remove everything from the dot to the end of the string

```
    let indexOfDot;
```

Use slice() method to get everything from the beginning of the string to to dot (but not including the dot)
