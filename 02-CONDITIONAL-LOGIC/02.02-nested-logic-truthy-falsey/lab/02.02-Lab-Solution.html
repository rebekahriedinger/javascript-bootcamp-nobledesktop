      // if the student is in high school, they get a grade of "A",
      // but if they are in college they get a grade of 4.
      // - If the student score is greater than or equal to 80
      // and less than 90, if the student is in high school,
      // they get a grade of "B", but if they are in college they get a
      // grade of 3.
      // - If the student score is greater than or equal to 70 and
      // less than 80, if the student is in high school, they get a
      // grade of "C", but if they are in college they get a grade of 2.
