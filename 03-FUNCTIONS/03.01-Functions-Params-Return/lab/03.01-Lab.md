<!-- ## Lab 03.01 - FUNCTION EXERCISES: -->

<!-- converting units -->

1.  The weight of anything on the moon is approximately 1/6 its weight on earth. So, a person who weighs 60 kg on earth would weigh 10 kg on the moon. Make a function called **calcMoonWeight** that:

- takes an earth weight as its input
- converts the earth weight to moon weight
- returns the moon weight

2.  Complete this function to convert the inputted **feet** value to meters
    and **return** the result. Conversion units: 39.37 inches = 1 meter;

```
    function convertDistance(feet) {
        // convert feet to meters
    }
```

3. Refactor the **convertDistance** function so that it can convert distances in both directions: feet-to-meters and meters-to-feet. You will need to provide some way for the function to know which conversion to do.

4.

5. Make a function called **squareIt** that:

   - takes one number as its input (argument)
   - squares that number (multiplies it by itself)
   - logs the answer to the console
     So, if you input 4, it logs 16.
     Run the function three times with different inputs.

6. Refactor the above previous function, so that:

   - instead of logging the answer, it returns the answer.
   - When you call the function, save the return value to a variable.
   - Log the variable to see if the function works.
     So, if you input 5, it returns 25.
     Run the function three times with different inputs.

7. Make a function that:

   - takes one number as its input (argument)
   - cubes the input number
   - returns the answer
     So, if you input 4, you get back 64.
     Run the function three times with different values.

8. Make another version of the previous function that:

   - takes one number as its input (argument)
   - if the number is even, it squares the number
   - but if the number is odd, it cubes the number
   - returns the answer.
     So, if you input 3, you get back 27.
     So, if you input 4, you get back 16.
     Run the function three times with different values.

9. Declare a function called **introducePet**, that:

   - has four parameters: **pet**, **name**, **age** and **sound**,
     each of which gets set when the function is called.
   - uses string interploation to make a message that includes all four arguments.
   - returns a message, such that if the arguments are **cat**, **Fluffy**, **3** and **Meow**, the returned message is: **Meow! My name is Fluffy! I am a 3-year-old cat!**.
     Run the function three times, with different pet inputs each time.

10. Declare a function **introduceSelf** with two parameters: **name** and **city**. The function does not have a return value, but instead logs a message, such as: **Hi! My name is Jill. I am from Miami!**

11. Declare a function with two parameters, **num1** and **num2**.
    The function call passes in two arguments, both numbers.  
    The function does the following math:

    - If the **num1** is greater than **num2**, subtract **num2** from **num1**
    - If **num1** is less than or equal to **num2**, add the numbers together.  
      Return the answer.
      Run the function twice, once with the numbers being subtracted, the other with the numbers being added.

12. Given: two sides of a right triangle as global variables **sideA** and **sideB**

- Write a function with parameters **a** and **b**
  - Function uses the Pythagorean Theorem (**a² + b² = c²**) to find the hypotenuse, **c**, of **a** and **b**.
  - Function returns **c**, the hyotenuse.
  - Call the function, passing in **sideA** and **sideB** as its two arguments.

12. Write a function that:

- takes in numbers of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters
- calculates the total value of all coins
- returns the total as dollars and cents, to two decimal places and with dollar-sign

13. Define a function that:

- takes the radius of a circle as its input
- calculates the area of the circle using the formula `A = πr2`
- returns (outputs) the area

```
    let radius = 6;

    function findAreaOfCircle(r) {
        let area = Math.PI * r**2;
        return area;
    }
```

Call the function, passing in `radius` as its argument. Set the function call equal to a variable to save the return value.

```
    let area1 = findAreaOfCircle(radius);
    console.log(area1); // 113.09733552923255
```
