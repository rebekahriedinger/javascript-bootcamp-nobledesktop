### Calculator Application

### Assigning Click Event Listeners on a Loop

### Working with Math Operator Buttons

This Calculator application is a simplified version of a calculator.

Here's what the calculator can do:

- Add, subtract, multiply or divide 2 numbers

Here's what the calculator cannot do:

- Perform any other math operations
- Calculate with more than 2 numbers
- Store answers (all is reset when you click "clear")

The user interface consists of buttons that call functions. The functions are called in order, as follows

**I. onNumberClick()**

- The user clicks a digit (0-9) or the decimal point to call the **onNumberClick()** function, which:
  - concatenates the digit (or decimal point) as **numStr**
  - updates the display in the ouput box.

**II. onOperatorClick()**

- The user clicks an operator (+,-,\*,/) to call the **onOperatorClick()** function, which:
  - converts **numStr** to **num**, an actual number
  - pushes **num** into the **nums** array
  - saves the operator to a variable, **oper**
  - updates the ouput box to include the operator

**III. onNumberClick() again**

- The user inputs the second number, which again calls **onNumberClick()**

**IV. calculateAnswer()**

- After entering the second number, the user clicks the equal sign (**=**) to call the **calculateAnswer()** function, which:
  - pushes the second number into the **nums** array
  - runs a series of if-statements, to determine what the operator is and to perform the correct calculation:
    - If operator is **'+'**, add the two numbers
    - If operator is **'-'**, subtract the second number from the first
    - If operator is **'\*'**, multiply the two numbers
    - If operator is **'/'**, divide the first number by the second
  - updates the ouput box to include the answer

**V. clearBox()**

- Clicking **clr** (clear) calls **clearBox()** function, which: - empties the box - resets the variables
<!-- - Clicking **del** (delete) calls **delete()** function, which:
    - removes the last item entered, be it number, decimal or operator -->

**output box NOT directly editable**  
To reduce the amount of code required for this application, the output box has been intentionally _not_ been made editable. Since the user cannot click inside the box and type, the only way to enter content into the box is by clicking the buttons.

**numbers cannot be erased / deteted**  
Also to reduce the amount of code required for this application, there is no delete button to remove content or change the inputted numbers.

1. Open the file **05.07-Calculator.html**, and take it for a spin in the browser:

- enter a number (as many digits as you like)
- click one of the four operators: **+, -, \*, /**
- enter another number
- click the **=** (equals) sign to get the answer
- click **clear** to reset

2. Have a look at the tags in the html file. Note that the "buttons" are actually divs:

```
    <section>
        <div id="0" class="num-btns">0</div>
        <div id="1" class="num-btns">1</div>
        <div id="2" class="num-btns">2</div>
        <div id="3" class="num-btns">3</div>
        <div id="4" class="num-btns">4</div>
        <div id="5" class="num-btns">5</div>
        <br>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div id="6" class="num-btns">6</div>
        <div id="7" class="num-btns">7</div>
        <div id="8" class="num-btns">8</div>
        <div id="9" class="num-btns">9</div>
        <div id="." class="num-btns">.</div>
        <div id="=" class="equals-btn">=</div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <div id="+" class="oper-btns">+</div>
        <div id="-" class="oper-btns">-</div>
        <div id="*" class="oper-btns">*</div>
        <div id="/" class="oper-btns">/</div>
        <div id="c" class="clear-btn">clear</div>
    </section>

    <div id="num-box">
        <!-- output appears here -->
    </div>
```

- The **num-btns** class occurs 10 times, once for each digit.
- The **oper-btns** class occurs 4 times, once for each operator.
- The **delete-btn**, **clear-btn** and **equals-btn** class occurs once each.

3. In the script tags, comment out the **FINAL.js** file and reactivate **START.js**.

4. Our task is to recreate **FINAL.js** from scratch, so open **05.07-Calculator-START.js**

We start by bringing in the "buttons". We will use **document.querySelectorAll()** to bring in multiple elements at once. These come in as an array of objects, known as a **Node List**.

5. Get the divs that have a class of **num-btns**. These are the digits from 0-9:

```
    const numBtnsArr = document.querySelectorAll('.num-btns');
```

6. Loop through the **numBtnsArr** array and assign event listeners to the objects:

```
    for(let i = 0; i < numBtnsArr.length; i++) {
        numBtnsArr[i].addEventListener('click', onNumberClick);
    }
```

7. Get the operator divs (+,-,\*,/), which have a class of **oper-btns**:

```
    const operBtnsArr = document.querySelectorAll('.oper-btns');
```

8. Loop through the **operBtnsArr** arrays, adding listeners to each item:

```
    for(let i = 0; i < operBtnsArr.length; i++) {
        operBtnsArr[i].addEventListener('click', onOperatorClick);
    }
```

9. Get the other three "buttons" which call functions; these are the **=** (equals) and **clear** buttons:

```
    const equalsBtn = document.querySelector('.equals-btn');
    equalsBtn.addEventListener('click', calculateAnswer);

    const deleteBtn = document.querySelector('.delete-btn');
    deleteBtn.addEventListener('click', delete);

    const clearBtn = document.querySelector('.clear-btn');
    clearBtn.addEventListener('click', clearBox);
```

10. Get the **num-box**, which is the div for the output:

```
    const numBox = document.getElementById('num-box');
    numBox.textContent = "";
```

11. Next, declare several global variables for use by the functions:

- **numStr**: for storing the inputted digit(s) as a string
- **nums**: an array for storing the two **numStr** values
- **num**: the numeric version of **numStr**, for doing the math
- **oper**: a string for storing the operator symbol
- **answer**: for storing the calculated result

```
    let numStr = "";
    let num = 0;
    let nums = [];
    let oper = '';
    let answer = 0;
```

12. Write the **onNumberClick()** function, which runs on click of any digit from 0-9 or the decimal point.

The **onNumberClick()** function concatenates the clicked digit onto **numStr**.

- The keyword **this** in a function always refers to the object which called the function, so **this.id** is the digit
- If the user clicks 1, 2, 3 in order, then **numStr** equals "123"
- The value of **numStr** is displayed in the box

```
    function onNumberClick() {
        numStr += this.id; // concatenate the clicked digit
        numBox.textContent += this.id; // updates the output box
    }
```

13. Write the **onOperatorClick()** function, which runs when an operator "button" is clicked:

- saves **this.id** (the clicked object id) to the **oper** variable
- pushes **numStr**, the second "number-like string", into the **nums** array
- resets **numStr** to make way for the second number
- outputs the operator, surrounded by spaces, to the box

```
    function onOperatorClick() {
        oper = this.id;
        nums.push(numStr);
        numStr = '';
        numBox.textContent += ' ' + oper + ' ';
    }
```

The user inputs the second of the two numbers. With each digit or decimal click, the **onNumberClick()** function is called, which concatenate the second "number-like string", saves it to **nums** and displays it in the box.

When the user is done inputting the second number, they click the equal sign, which calls the **calculateAnswer()** function.

14. Write the **calculateAnswer()** function, which:

- pushes the second "number-like string" into the **nums** array
- converts the two array items to actual numbers, using the **Number()** method and saves the results as variables, **num1** and **num2**
- runs a series of if-statements to identify the operator and does the correct mathematical calculation based on the operator
- runs an if-else-statement, which passes the **answer** to the **Number.isInteger()** method, which returns true if the answer is an integer. Else, the answer is a float, which gets passed to the **toFixed()** method, which rounds it to 7 decimal places
- The **answer** is outputted, preceded by **' = '**

```
    function calculateAnswer() {
        nums.push(numStr);
        let num1 = Number(nums[0]);
        let num2 = Number(nums[1]);
        if(oper == '+') answer = num1 + num2;
        if(oper == '-') answer = num1 - num2;
        if(oper == '*') answer = num1 * num2;
        if(oper == '/') answer = num1 / num2;
        if(Number.isInteger(answer)) {
            numBox.textContent += ' = ' + answer;
        } else { // not an integer
            numBox.textContent += ' = ' + answer.toFixed(7);
        }
    }
```

15. Write the **clearBox()** function, which empties the output box and resets the global variables. The calculator is ready for fresh input.

```
    function clearBox() {
        numBox.textContent = '';
        nums = [];
        num = 0;
        oper = '';
        total = 0;
        numStr = '';
    }
```
