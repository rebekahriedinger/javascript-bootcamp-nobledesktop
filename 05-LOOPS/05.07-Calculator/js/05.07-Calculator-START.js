// Calculator

// Calculator Application
// Assigning Click Event Listeners on a Loop
// Working with Math Operator Buttons

// 5. Get the divs that have a class of **num-btns**. These are the digits from 0-9:

// 6. Loop through the numBtnsArr array and assign event listeners to the objects:

// 7. Get the operator divs (+,-,*,/), which have a class of oper-btns:

// 8. Loop through the operBtnsArr arrays, adding listeners to each item:

// 9. Get the other three "buttons" which call functions; these are the = (equals) and clear buttons:

// 10. Get the **num-box**, which is the div for the output:

// 11. Next, declare several global variables for use by the functions:
let numStr;
let num;
let nums;
let oper;
let answer;

// 12. Write the onNumberClick() function, which runs on click of any digit from 0-9 or the decimal point.

// 13. Write the onOperatorClick() function, which runs when an operator "button" is clicked:

// 14. Write the calculateAnswer() function, which:

// 15. Write the **clearBox()** function, which empties the output box and resets the global variables. The calculator is ready for fresh input.
